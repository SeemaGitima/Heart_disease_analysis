# Heart_disease_analysis using Python
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset using Python with data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations. As part of my data science learning journey, the goal is to practice handling data, explore different graphs, and gain insights through real-world health data.
**21. Maximum Heart Rate and Heart Disease Risk:**

A scatter or boxplot showing maximum heart rate, highlighting whether lower or higher rates relate to heart disease.

**22. Exercise-Induced Chest Pain:**

A countplot examining chest pain during exercise, indicating increased likelihood of heart disease among affected patients.

**23. “Oldpeak” (ST Depression) Relation:**

A boxplot showing ST depression values (“oldpeak”) by heart disease status, reflecting exercise-induced cardiac stress.

**24. Resting ECG Result Differences:**

A countplot comparing resting ECG results for patients with and without heart disease, identifying potential diagnostic patterns.

**25. Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment:**

A barplot illustrating the relationship between ST segment slope during peak exercise and heart disease occurrence.

**26. Thalassemia Types and Heart Disease:**

A countplot evaluating different thalassemia (thal) types, highlighting their association with heart disease prevalence.

**27. Age and Cholesterol Combined Risk:**

A scatterplot of age versus cholesterol, showing how higher values together may increase heart disease risk.

**28. Sex and Chest Pain Type Influence:**

A grouped barplot analyzing how gender and chest pain types jointly impact heart disease likelihood.

**29. Dataset Balance for Target Variable:**

A bar chart showing distribution of the target variable, identifying whether the dataset is balanced or skewed.

**30. Features Most Strongly Correlated with Heart Disease:**

A heatmap or correlation matrix highlighting features with strongest positive or negative correlations to heart disease.

**31. Distribution of Serum Cholesterol:**

A histogram or boxplot showing serum cholesterol distribution across all patients in the dataset.

**32. Resting Blood Pressure Comparison by Sex:**

Boxplots comparing resting blood pressure between male and female patients, highlighting sex-based differences.

**33. Continuous Variables Plot:**

Pairplots or histograms visualizing all continuous features, providing an overview of distributions and relationships.
